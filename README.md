# Loose Equality Comparison with Null in JavaScript

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug involving loose equality (==) comparisons with null values.  The bug arises from JavaScript's type coercion during loose comparisons, which can lead to unexpected behavior and logic errors.

## Bug Description
The `bug.js` file contains a function that attempts to handle null values using loose equality. This approach is problematic because loose equality doesn't reliably distinguish between null and other falsy values like 0 or ''.  This can lead to unintended code execution or skipped logic.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the function using strict equality (===).  Strict equality prevents type coercion, providing a more reliable comparison and avoiding the potential bug.

## How to reproduce the bug
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.js`. Observe the function's behavior with various inputs, including null, 0, '', and other values.
3. Run `bugSolution.js`. Compare the output with the original function.
